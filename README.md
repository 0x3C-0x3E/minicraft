# !PRE-ALPHA!
this is still in *pre-alpha* and i dont even really know what to do with it (:

## Installation

don't.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0x3C-0x3E/minicraft.git
make -j8
cd build
./project

```

## What is this?
This is a way too overengineered game written in C with pure SDL. It is mostly just a learning exercise and probably wont be developed much further
